"""
this is where the audio functions are created, the user here, has to interact with the  agent  using voice command, 
and the  agent  will respond with voice. The user can ask for the weather, time, search for something on the web
and summarize content. The user can also ask for the  agent  to create a task for them. the agent  is an agent.
all the functions are asynchronous and the user can interact with the agent using voice commands, it will be like a conversation and infinite loop so that the user can keep interacting with the agent.
all the other functions are imported from other files and the user can interact with the agent using voice commands, eg: ai.py, webScrapeAndProcess.py, weather.py, realtimeSearch.py, tasks.py, sendEmail.py, docsprocessing.py.
the user can also ask for the agent to summarize content for them



here, the API that will be used:
- Assemblyai api for speech to text
- Assemblyai for speech to text
-Google Text-to-Speech API
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
- OpenAI API




The logic of the code is as follows:
- the user will interact with the agent using voice commands
- the agent will respond with voice
- the user can ask for the weather, time, search for something on the web and summarize content
- the user can also ask for the agent to create a task for them
- the user can also ask for the agent to summarize content for them
can be able to scrape webpages using SerpAPI, summarise the content from the current page, and return the summary to the user
the credential path will be same as the one in sendEmail.py, credentials.json
